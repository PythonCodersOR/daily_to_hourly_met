# Full Description
Data input for HSPF hydrologic modeling of the Siletz River. There are 17 catchments within contributing watershed, each with distinct climatic conditions. Convert 30 years of daily precipitation and PET totals in mm/day to average hourly rates in inches/hour. No assumptions are made about diurnal or hyetographic characteristics of the data. These data are derived from PRISM and the only condition in that the totals are cumulative up to noon GMT, which is 4am PST time, so the measurements for any given day represents the cumulative measurements prior to 4am, and then resets thereafter.
